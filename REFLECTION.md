## Reflection

Working on this project was a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience for me. I initially struggled with concept design and needed to seek guidance during office hours to strengthen my approach. In hindsight, I realize that I took on too much in my original specification, which made implementation in Assignment 4 particularly difficult.

My difficulties stemmed from two main areas. First, my initial concepts were overly complex and unfocused, which made them hard to build, test, and integrate. As documented in my backend deprecation notes, some of these ideas—such as the dynamic exit planner and assorted monitors—were too nebulous to work well as clear concepts. When it came time to refine my work for Assignment 4C, I focused on mastering the idea of a "concept" and understanding how it enables effective use of LOM.

As I describe in the design file, I shifted toward simpler, more concrete concepts, like users, user history, and profiles. The most important realization for me was in creating an LM route planner, which brought together the routing ideas from Assignment 3. This was my first solid attempt at a proper "concept," and it ended up encapsulating much of my website's functionality. I learned that a well-designed concept doesn't need to be closely tied to backend or frontend notions; it can stand independently, which enables greater flexibility and functionality.

Adopting new tools—particularly the context tool—was initially challenging, but it changed the way I think about applying context more generally. In Assignment 4C, I focused on using the context tool together with the agentic tool to create detailed specifications, maintaining consistency in how context was provided and used. I made a point of instructing the tools to search through the context folder before implementing any feature, which led to significant improvements.

While I found that the context tool was generally effective at managing and applying context, there were occasional issues with it skipping files. However, as long as information was present in the context window, it was taken into account, which was helpful. Although there were some additional difficulties dealing with sinks, these challenges were addressable with some persistence.

Overall, this project greatly improved my understanding of concept design and tool usage in a complex software setting. I made mistakes early on, but learned valuable lessons about the importance of focus, simplicity, and effective use of supporting tools.
